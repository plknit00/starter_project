<h1>Python Starter Project</h1>
<h3>By the end of this projecct, you will be familiar with github, terminal, vscode, and python.</h3>
<h3>Below are steps outlining how to get started:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Create a public repository named "python_calculator" in github and include a README file.</li>
  <li>Copy and paste this README into yours.</li>
  <li>Commit the changes to save your updated README.</li>
  <li>Click the green code button, make sure ssh is highlighted, and click the copy url square button.</li>
  <li>Open VSCode, and click "Clone Git Repository".</li>
  <li>Paste the url you copied.</li>
  <li>Select either Desktop or Documents as your place to clone this repository and select open.</li>
  <li>Create a file in VSCode and name it "calculator.py".</li>
  <ol>
    <li>This can be done by going over to the file window on the left in VSCode and hovering over the project file name.</li>
    <li>The left-most button that looks like a piece of paper with a plus is the new file button. Click it!</li>
    <li>All python files must end in .py, so name it according to that and the project style.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Now you are good to get stared with your project!</li>
</ol>
<h3>Below are requirements for the project:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Create a four function calculator in Python.</li>
  <li>Allow user input for two numbers they wish to compute with.</li>
  <li>Use print statements to communicate to user how the calculator works and to print results.</li>
  <li>Do not use if statements for the four different cases, create functions for the computation.</li>
  <li>Use the internet as much as needed to assist in your project.</li>
</ol>
<h3>How to run a python script:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Open a new terminal window in VSCode.</li>
  <li>Type: "python3 calculator.py" to run the calculator.py file.</li>
  <li>To test this before you have any code written down, type "print("Hello World.")" into your python file and save it, then run the python3 command in terminal and check for a print statement.</li>
</ol>
<h3>How to commit new code to github:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Save current files.</li>
  <li>Go to terminal window.</li>
  <li>Type: "git add ."</li>
  <li>Type: "git commit -m &ltdescription of edits made&gt" </li>
  <li>Type: "git push"</li>
</ol>
<h3>How to check if any edits have been made since previous commit:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Go to terminal window.</li>
  <li>Type: "git status".</li>
  <li>This will return either that everything is up to date or that some files have been modified.</li>
</ol>
